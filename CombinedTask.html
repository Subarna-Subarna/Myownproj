    <h2> Definition</h2>
    A flower, also known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the
    division Angiospermae). Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs sepals that enclose and protect the
    developing flower, petals that attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce gametophytes, which in
    flowering plants produce gametes.The male gametophytes, which produce sperm, are enclosed within pollen grains
    produced in the anthers.The female gametophytes are contained within the ovules produced in the carpels<br>
    <h3>Etymology</h3>
    Flower is from the Middle English flour, which referred to both the ground grain and the reproductive structure in
    plants, before splitting off in the 17th century.It comes originally from the Latin name of the Italian goddess of
    flowers, Flora. The early word for flower in English was blossom, though it now refers to flowers only of fruit
    tree<br>

    <h4>Morphology</h4>
    The morphology of a flower, or its form and structure, can be considered in two parts: the vegetative part,
    consisting of non-reproductive structures such as petals; and the reproductive or sexual parts. A stereotypical
    flower is made up of four kinds of structures attached to the tip of a short stalk or axis, called a receptacle.
    Each of these parts or floral organs is arranged in a spiral called a whorl The four main whorls (starting from the
    base of the flower or lowest node and working upwards) are the calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium. Together
    the calyx and corolla make up the non-reproductive part of the flower called the perianth, and in some cases may not
    be differentiated. If this is the case, then they are described as tepals</p>

      <!-- Underline -->
      <li><b><u>Vegetative Parts</u></b></li><br>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li><b><i>Petals:</i></b> Petal, in flowering plants, a sterile floral part that usually functions as a visually conspicuous element of a flower. Petals are modified leaves and are often brightly coloured to attract specific pollinators to the flower. Petals often come in multiples of three in monocots or in multiples of four or five in eudicots. Many horticultural flowers, such as roses and peonies, have been bred to have multiple layers of petals, resulting in showy textured blooms.</li> <br>
      <li><b><i>Sepals:</i></b> Sepal, any of the outer parts of a flower that enclose and protect the unopened flower bud. The sepals on a flower are collectively referred to as the calyx. They are sterile floral parts and may be either green or leaflike or composed of petal-like tissue. From their base and along most of their length, sepals remain either separate (aposepalous, or polysepalous) or marginally fused (synsepalous), forming a tube with terminal lobes or teeth. The number of calyx lobes equals the number of fused (connate) sepals, and the number of sepals is usually the same as the number of petals.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <ul>
      <li><b><u>Reproductive Parts</u></b></li><br>
    </ul>
    <ol class="d">
      <li><b><i>Stamen:</i></b>Stamen, the male reproductive part of a flower. In all but a few extant angiosperms, the stamen consists of a long slender stalk, the filament, with a two-lobed anther at the tip. The anther consists of four saclike structures (microsporangia) that produce pollen for pollination. Small secretory structures, called nectaries, are often found at the base of the stamens; they provide food rewards for insect and bird pollinators. All the stamens of a flower are collectively called the androecium. For a discussion of the female reproductive parts of a flower, see pistil.</li> <br>
      <li><b><i>Pistil:</i></b> Pistil, the female reproductive part of a flower. The pistil, centrally located, typically consists of a swollen base, the ovary, which contains the potential seeds, or ovules; a stalk, or style, arising from the ovary; and a pollen-receptive tip, the stigma, variously shaped and often sticky. In pollination, compatible pollen grains land on the stigma and then germinate, forming a pollen tube. The pollen tube grows down through the tissue of the style to deposit sperm for the fertilization of the ovules in the ovary. Pistils in the collective sense form the gynoecium, in distinction to the male reproductive parts, or androecium </li>

  <h2>Form and types</h2>Basically, each flower consists of a floral axis upon which are borne the essential organs of reproduction (stamens and pistils) and usually accessory organs (sepals and petals); the latter may serve to both attract pollinating insects and protect the essential organs. The floral axis is a greatly modified stem; unlike vegetative stems, which bear leaves, it is usually contracted, so that the parts of the flower are crowded together on the stem tip, the receptacle. The flower parts are usually arrayed in whorls (or cycles) but may also be disposed spirally, especially if the axis is elongate. There are commonly four distinct whorls of flower parts: (1) an outer calyx consisting of sepals; within it lies (2) the corolla, consisting of petals; (3) the androecium, or group of stamens; and in the centre is (4) the gynoecium, consisting of the pistils.A lily flower with a central pistil surrounded by stamens. The six orange structures are pollen-laden anthers, each borne at the end of a stalk known as a filament.The sepals and petals together make up the perianth, or floral envelope. The sepals are usually greenish and often resemble reduced leaves, while the petals are usually colourful and showy. Sepals and petals that are indistinguishable, as in lilies and tulips, are sometimes referred to as tepals. The androecium, or male parts of the flower, comprise the stamens, each of which consists of a supporting filament and an anther, in which pollen is produced. The gynoecium, or female parts of the flower, comprises one or more pistils, each of which consists of an ovary, with an upright extension, the style, on the top of which rests the stigma, the pollen-receptive surface. The ovary encloses the ovules, or potential seeds. A pistil may be simple, made up of a single carpel, or ovule-bearing modified leaf; or compound, formed from several carpels joined together. A perfect flower with floral structures in multiples of three, Tulipa (tulip) has a three-lobed stigma, six stamens, and six distinct perianth parts. A flower having sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils is complete; lacking one or more of such structures, it is said to be incomplete. Stamens and pistils are not present together in all flowers. When both are present the flower is said to be perfect, or bisexual, regardless of a lack of any other part that renders it incomplete (see photograph). A flower that lacks stamens is pistillate, or female, while one that lacks pistils is said to be staminate, or male. When the same plant bears unisexual flowers of both sexes, it is said to be monoecious (e.g., tuberous begonia, hazel, oak, corn); when the male and female flowers are on different plants, the plant is dioecious (e.g., date, holly, cottonwood, willow); when there are male, female, and bisexual flowers on the same plant, the plant is termed polygamous.Compare the Rafflesia arnoldii's massive bloom with Amorphophallus titanum's towering inflorescence. An overview of the world's largest blooms: the monster flower (Rafflesia arnoldii) and the titan arum (Amorphophallus titanum). To attract pollinators, both produce a rotting-meat scent, which has earned them the nickname “corpse flower.” The radiate head of the treasure flower (Gazania rigens), a daisylike inflorescence composed of disk flowers in the centre surrounded by marginal ray flowers.Bilateral symmetry of the orchid (Vanda). A flower may be radially symmetrical (see photograph), as in roses and petunias, in which case it is termed regular or actinomorphic. A bilaterally symmetrical flower, as in orchids (see photograph) and snapdragons, is irregular or zygomorphic.</p></section>
